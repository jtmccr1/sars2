# Visualization of Sars-Cov2 phylogengy

This is an experiment in displaying uncertain topologies. It is being developed concurrently with my other repository figtreejs-react and installs that dependency from a sibling directory.

Analysis was done by Verity Hill, Sam Hong, Guy Baele, and Phillipe Lemey.

Genetic data was obtained from  http://gisaid.org  and table of acknowledgments is in the public directory.
